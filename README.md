# Acronym Finder

Exams are the bane of the lives of students. When I was memorising things I often used acronyms to remember. For example

*Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain*

This is an easy way to remember the colours of the rainbow which are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet.

It's a fact in life that advertising by brands is a hugely effective way of making people remember slogans.
 
 These can be broken down into acronyms too. Below are some example of very popular slogans

|Slogan| Company|
|-------|-------|
|The ultimate driving machine | BMW|
|The world's favourite airline.  |British Airways|
|It's good to talk               |British Telecom|
|Just Do It      |Nike|

For example if I wanted to remember a list of things that was _DIJ_ and the order made no meaning then I could remember Nike's slogan
By remembering Nike's slogan I know that the the three items in this list each start with a J, a D and an I

This does not just relate to slogans too. Song titles could be used to remember among other things. 

This project allows you to enters letters that you want to memorise and then it returns (hopefully) a more memorable acronym to help jog your memory.

TODO:
* better names for classes
* create the importer to read from a file
* return more than one mnemonics (ie a list rather than just one)
* I18N it all
